## Build History

The entire collection was built on 25 February 2026 in two phases:

**Phase 1** — Initial launch of 51 visualisations covering all 10 chapters, the physics appendix, custom domain configuration, and footer credits.

**Phase 2** — 10 additional visualisations to complete the foundational expansion:
- Unit Circle
- Inverse Trigonometric Functions
- Parametric Curves & Polar Coordinates
- Modular Arithmetic
- Fermat's Little Theorem & Primality
- Coordinate Geometry
- Geometric Transformations
- Differential Equations
- Correlation & Regression
- Logarithms & Exponentials

**Phase 3** — Chapter 11: Quantitative Finance (1 March 2026) — 10 new visualisations:
- Compound Interest & Time Value of Money
- Random Walks & Brownian Motion
- Monte Carlo Simulation in Finance
- Bond Pricing & Risk
- Yield Curve Construction & Bootstrapping
- Portfolio Theory & the Efficient Frontier
- The Black-Scholes Model
- The Greeks
- Option Payoffs & Strategies
- Volatility Smiles & Surfaces

## Potential Next Steps

The following are ideas for future development, not commitments. They are listed roughly by impact and feasibility.

### Content Enhancements
- **Deeper interactivity** — Add more parameter controls, guided explorations, and "what if" scenarios to existing visualisations
- **Worked examples** — Step-by-step problem solving panels alongside visualisations
- **Cross-references** — Links between related topics (e.g., complex numbers ↔ Euler's identity ↔ unit circle)
- **New topics** — Candidates include: graph theory, number theory (RSA), optimization, game theory, fractal geometry, chaos theory

### User Experience
- **Search and filter** — Allow users to search topics by name or filter by chapter/difficulty from the index page
- **Progress dashboard** — Visual summary of topics visited vs. remaining (building on existing localStorage tracking)
- **Keyboard navigation** — Full keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- **Touch improvements** — Better touch interaction for mobile and tablet devices
- **Dark/light theme toggle** — Option for users who prefer a light background

### Accessibility
- **Screen reader support** — ARIA labels for all interactive canvas elements
- **Alt text descriptions** — Text descriptions of what each visualisation shows
- **Reduced motion mode** — Option to disable animations for users who prefer it

### Infrastructure
- **Automated testing** — Visual regression tests to catch rendering issues
- **Performance audit** — Ensure all pages load under 1 second on slow connections
- **Analytics** — Privacy-respecting usage data to understand which topics are most popular
- **Print-friendly versions** — Static snapshots of key states for offline study
- **Multi-language support** — Translations starting with the most-requested languages
