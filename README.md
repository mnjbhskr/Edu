# A Visual Discovery of Mathematics

**An interactive journey through 2,500 years of human thought**

Mathematics is the foundation of all science, yet too often it is taught as rules to memorise rather than ideas to discover. This collection of **71 interactive visualisations** across **11 chapters** invites you to see, touch, and explore the great theorems — from Euclid's geometry to Euler's identity — and build genuine intuition for the most powerful language humanity has ever created.

## What's Inside

| Chapter | Topics | Highlights |
|---------|--------|------------|
| 1. Logic & Proof | 3 | Truth tables, proof by contradiction, induction |
| 2. Numbers | 6 | Prime sieve, Cantor's diagonal, modular arithmetic |
| 3. Geometry | 8 | Euclid's axioms, Pythagoras, conic sections, non-Euclidean |
| 4. Algebra | 6 | Complex numbers, fundamental theorem, logarithms |
| 5. Trigonometry & Waves | 7 | Unit circle, Fourier transform, parametric curves |
| 6. Calculus | 7 | Derivatives, integration, Taylor series, differential equations |
| 7. Linear Algebra | 5 | Vectors, eigenvalues, SVD |
| 8. Probability & Statistics | 6 | Bayes' theorem, CLT, correlation & regression |
| 9. Analysis & Topology | 6 | Bolzano-Weierstrass, Mobius strip, Gaussian curvature |
| 10. Beautiful Results | 6 | Euler's identity, Mandelbrot set, Riemann hypothesis |
| 11. Quantitative Finance | 10 | Black-Scholes, Greeks, bond pricing, yield curves, Monte Carlo |
| Appendix — Physics | 1 | Atomic energy levels |
